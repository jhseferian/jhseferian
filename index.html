     <font face="tahoma"> On Monday, May 5, ex-club-kid impresario Michael Alig was released from Mid-State Correctional Facility, where he’d been incarcerated since his 1997 first-degree manslaughter conviction, after Alig and Robert “Freeze” Riggs bludgeoned fellow nightlife denizen/drug dealer Andre “Angel” Melendez with a hammer before dismembering him and throwing him in the Hudson River.

Alig was picked up at the prison gate by some old nightlife friends: lighting designer turned DJ Scotto and former club kid/current hairstylist Astro Erle. (James St. James was supposed to be there to film Alig’s return for production company World of Wonder, but of course, he missed his plane.) The church that housed the Limelight, where Alig’s Disco 2000 party reigned supreme, is now a dreary shopping mall (and will soon become a David Barton Gym). As for the club kids — those decadent nightclub celebrities who were once talk-show fixtures — they’ve changed just as much as their old digs. Here’s what the scene’s figureheads are up to now.

  <p><b>Freeze/ Robert Riggs</b>: Alig’s partner in crime was paroled in 2010. According to St. James, Riggs is attending NYU and “disappearing into academia, I think comparative literature. He’s moving on with his life and not seeing anybody.”</p>

  <p><b>James St. James</b>: Wrote the memoir Party Monster about his relationship with Alig. “I looked like I was having fun,” he says of the Limelight years, “but I was tweaked out of my mind and too wasted to have fun.” He’s been in Los Angeles since 1997. “I came out as a bedraggled drug addict,” he says. He’s contributed to World of Wonder since his move. His second book, Freakshow, about a bullied high school drag queen, has been optioned by Drew Barrymore’s Flower Films and is in the casting stage.</p>

  <p><b>Richie Rich</b>: With partner Traver Rains, Rich designed the now-defunct clothing line Heatherette, and then went solo with Poplux, which showed a few times during Fashion Week. He and Rains are planning a Heatherette reboot, and Rich is working on a self-titled solo line. “I’m trickling back into the glitter puddle,” he says.</p>

  <p><b>Amanda Lepore</b>: Is still an internationally sought-after mystery blonde.</p>

  <p><b>Keoki</b>: Alig’s former boyfriend and Disco 2000 resident is still working in music and lives in Houston.</p>

  <p><b>Walt Cassidy</b>: Known as Walt Paper, Cassidy is a tattooed, muscled multimedia artist. He is represented by Invisible Exports and his work has been exhibited at venues like MASS MOCA, Paul Kasmin Gallery, Deitch Projects, 303 Gallery, and the Watermill Center. On the 20th, he is releasing his one-of-a-kind jewelry collection using materials like quartz, pyrite, and coconut shells. “I see them as mini sculptures,” he says.  It will be sold at ODD. Starting May 29, a light sculpture will be part of “Trip the Lights Fantastic” at High Line Gallery.</p>

  <p><b>Jenny Dembrow</b>: Once known as Jenny Talia, Dembrow was the perennial club kid “It” girl and one of the most prominent of the Limelight crew, bounding down the Calvin Klein catwalk in all of her bald-headed glory. Now the club she’s most interested in is the Lower East Side Girls Club, where she’s associate executive editor, and she has recently become a mother.</p>

  <p><b>Sophia Lamar</b>: Still works in nightlife and has just wrapped a movie called Zentuary, “about the human condition and human trafficking,” she says. “I play a stressed young mother who has her child killed accidentally.”</font></p>
